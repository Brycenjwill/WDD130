        <p class="Q1">Is this a good trip for kids? </p>
            <p class="A1">Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age.</p>

        <p class="Q2">Is whitewater rafting safe?</p>
            <p class="A2">As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. </p>
        <p class="Q3">What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</p>
            <p class="A3">Beint surrounded by nature, the thrill of the rapids, and great food rapped up into one day. Plus, lifelong friends are commonly made on the river.</p>
